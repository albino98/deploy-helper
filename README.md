# Configuration and Requirements

Python 3.x and pyqt5 are required to run the project.

To install PyQt5, PyQt5-tools, QtDesigner and PyUIC you can see this tutorial: https://pythonpyqt.com/how-to-install-pyqt5-in-pycharm/

**Note** that the path of the qt designer can be very different so you will have to be patient to find it. In my case the path was this: C:\Users\*MyUser*\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\site-packages\qt5_applications\Qt\designer.exe
